# Requirements: MemBlocks MCP Server

**Defined:** 2026-03-12
**Milestone:** v1.1 — MCP Server
**Core Value:** Any AI agent connected to MemBlocks can store and retrieve the right memory from the right block at the right time, with conflict resolution and source transparency.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for the MCP Server milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Foundation

- [x] **FOUND-01**: MCP server runs as a standalone stdio process with a singleton MemBlocksClient initialized at startup via FastMCP lifespan
- [x] **FOUND-02**: Server reads user_id and MemBlocksConfig from environment variables / .env file on startup
- [x] **FOUND-03**: Active block state is persisted in a shared JSON state file (`~/.config/memblocks/active_block.json`)
- [x] **FOUND-04**: Any tool call returns a clear error message if no active block is set, without crashing the server
- [x] **FOUND-05**: MCP server entry point is registered in pyproject.toml and runnable as `memblocks-mcp`

### Block Management Tools

- [x] **BLCK-01**: Agent can list all blocks for the configured user via `memblocks_list_blocks` MCP tool, including which block is currently active
- [x] **BLCK-02**: Agent can create a new block with a name and optional description via `memblocks_create_block` MCP tool

### Store Tools

- [ ] **STOR-01**: Agent can store a fact to semantic memory via `memblocks_store_semantic`, which accepts plain text, runs LLM extraction (PS1) and conflict resolution (PS2)
- [ ] **STOR-02**: Agent can update core memory via `memblocks_store_to_core`, which accepts plain text, wraps it as a message, and runs LLM core memory update
- [x] **STOR-03**: Agent can store to both semantic and core memory in one call via `memblocks_store`, which runs both pipelines sequentially

### Retrieve Tools

- [x] **RETR-01**: Agent can retrieve relevant memories (core + semantic) for a query string via `memblocks_retrieve`, returning formatted context ready for LLM injection
- [x] **RETR-02**: Agent can retrieve only core memory (full, no query needed) via `memblocks_retrieve_core`
- [x] **RETR-03**: Agent can retrieve only semantic memories relevant to a query via `memblocks_retrieve_semantic`

### CLI Commands

- [x] **CLI-01**: User can set the active block by block ID via `memblocks-cli set-block <block_id>`, which writes to the shared state file
- [x] **CLI-02**: User can view the current active block (name, ID) via `memblocks-cli get-block`

### MCP Resources

- [x] **RES-01**: MCP resource `memblocks://active-block` exposes current block name, ID, and description so agents can read context without making a tool call
- [x] **RES-02**: MCP resource `memblocks://tools` exposes a usage guide documenting all available tools, their purpose, and when to use each

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Extended Memory Types

- **EXT-01**: Agent can store and retrieve resource memories (documents, PDFs) via MCP tools
- **EXT-02**: Resource chunking and embedding pipeline accessible via MCP

### Multi-block Operations

- **MULTI-01**: Agent can retrieve from multiple blocks simultaneously in a single call
- **MULTI-02**: Agent can specify block ID per tool call instead of relying on active block state

### Observability

- **OBS-01**: MCP server exposes token usage and retrieval stats via a dedicated resource
- **OBS-02**: Agent can query the operation log (what was stored/updated/deleted) via an MCP tool

### Advanced Configuration

- **ADV-01**: HTTP transport option for team/shared MCP server deployments
- **ADV-02**: Per-agent namespacing within a shared block

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Session / memory window / MemoryPipeline.run() | Agents push distilled facts, not full conversation history; no pipeline trigger needed |
| OAuth / multi-user in MCP | Single-user per server instance; complexity without clear value for local use |
| HTTP transport | stdio is sufficient for local clients; HTTP adds deployment complexity |
| Resource memory (documents/PDFs) in MCP tools | Resource memory is a stub in the library; premature to expose |
| Streaming MCP responses | Not needed for memory operations; all operations complete before returning |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Phase Name | Status |
|-------------|-------|------------|--------|
| FOUND-01 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| FOUND-02 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| FOUND-03 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| FOUND-04 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| FOUND-05 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| BLCK-01 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| BLCK-02 | Phase 1 | Foundation | Pending |
| STOR-01 | Phase 2 | Store Tools | Pending |
| STOR-02 | Phase 2 | Store Tools | Pending |
| STOR-03 | Phase 2 | Store Tools | Pending |
| RETR-01 | Phase 3 | Retrieve Tools | Complete |
| RETR-02 | Phase 3 | Retrieve Tools | Complete |
| RETR-03 | Phase 3 | Retrieve Tools | Complete |
| CLI-01 | Phase 4 | CLI + Resources | Complete |
| CLI-02 | Phase 4 | CLI + Resources | Complete |
| RES-01 | Phase 4 | CLI + Resources | Complete |
| RES-02 | Phase 4 | CLI + Resources | Complete |
